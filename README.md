# Overview
This is my first project in Solidity and Ethereum! I've learned how to deploy and run a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain.

# Land
The purpose of this smart contract is to simplify land registration and eliminate scammers. It includes various methods, and here are a few important ones:

- `transferOwnership`: This function transfers the ownership of the land to another Ethereum account. Only the account specified in the owner variable can execute this function.
- `whoIsTheOwner`: This function allows others to find out who the owner of the land is.
- `changeMyDetails`: This function enables the owner to modify their details. Only the owner can call this function.

# YouTube Videos

If you're interested in learning Solidity and smart contracts, I found these videos helpful in gaining a better understanding of the concepts. Each video has a maximum duration of 20 minutes:

- [Learn Solidity in 20 minutes!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQzuQb0dfBM)
